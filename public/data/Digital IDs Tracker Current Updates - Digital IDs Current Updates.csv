As of February 2022, the pilot  has been operational in 11 regions, including the Olympic venues in Beijing and  Zhangjiakou. During the Olympic Games, both foreign and domestic visitors could use the e-CNY wallet. ",,"In 2017, as a part of a wider push to develop its high-technology sectors, China launched a project called Digital Currency Electronic Payments, or “DCEP."" Since then, Chinese officials have said the digital currency will have “controllable anonymity,"" allowing the government to provide a level of privacy while also regulating against money laundering and other illicit activity. In April 2020, China piloted the digital currency in four cities, allowing commercial banks to run internal tests like conversions between cash and digital money, account-balance checks, and payments. In August, the pilot program expanded to 28 major cities, across 10 regions. As of June 2021, the PBOC announced that more than 20.87 million personal and 3.51 million corporate digital yuan wallets had been opened, with a total transaction value of around $5.39 billion. According to October 2021 numbers, 123 million individual wallets and 9.2 million corporate wallets had been opened with transaction volume of 142 million and transaction value of RMB 56 billion (equivalent to approximately $8.8 billion). Reports from early 2022 indicate that more than 260 million wallets have been opened.<br/><br/>The PBOC has also begun laying the groundwork for the e-CNY to be used in cross-border transactions. Aiming for broad circulation in 2022, the People’s Bank of China and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority have begun ‘technical testing’ for cross-border use of the digital yuan in Hong Kong. In 2021, China announced its plan to test it with foreign visitors at the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics. In February 2021, an announcement was made that the PBOC joined central banks from Thailand, the United Arab Emirates, and Hong Kong to explore a cross-border wholesale CBDC project named Multiple Central Bank Digital Currency (m-CBDC) Bridge. In July 2021, the PBOC announced that foreign travelers to China will be able to use e-CNY even without domestic bank accounts if they provide their passport information. The e-CNY offers offline functionality and different levels of anonymity standards corresponding to transaction and balance limits. In February 2022, visitors to the Olympic Games venues in Beijing and Zhangjiakou were able to use the software e-CNY application and the hardware e-CNY card, and daily transactions during the Games were around ""a couple of million RMB"" or over $300,000.

In September 2021, the deputy chairwoman of the Bank of Russia announced that they will start testing the digital ruble with a pilot in January 2022 and that they see no obstacle to its eventual launch. In February 2022, Bank of Russia began testing the digital ruble platform after successfully completing transactions using the prototype platform. ",,"In October 2020 the Bank of Russia announced plans to release a prototype CBDC in 2021. 83% of the feedback the bank had received was in favor of its development. The Bank plans to draft regulatory norms for the currency’s integration in 2022. The proposed digital ruble would be built on a hybrid platform with distributed ledger technology, likely using open-source code. Some Russian banks and fintech companies have expressed concerns that the models proposed are excessively centralized and could harm private banks' business by forcing them to compete with the central bank, while analysts are concerned about the degree of economic control a digital ruble could grant the central bank, possibly including the ability to bar unfavored entities from the Russian economic system. The Bank of Russia has also stated that launching a CBDC will decrease their dependence on the US dollar and potentially help in side-stepping US sanctions. In June 2021, the Bank announced a partnership with 12 banks, including Sberbank, VTB, Gazprombank, and Alfa Bank. In February 2022, the Russian central bank announced that it had created a prototype of the digital ruble platform, and that two partner banks had successfully completed a full cycle of digital ruble transfers through mobile banking applications. The bank also announced a phased development of the pilot, focusing on different features across the testing process. At the end of the testing period, Bank of Russia seeks to create a roadmap for the launch of the digital ruble.
